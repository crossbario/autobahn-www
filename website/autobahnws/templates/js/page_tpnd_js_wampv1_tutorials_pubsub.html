      <h1>Publish &amp; Subscribe with {{ autobahnjs() }}</h1>

         <p>
            The goal of this tutorial is to introduce publish and subscribe (PubSub) messaging with {{ autobahnjs() }}.
         </p>
         <p>
            Publish &amp; Subscribe is a messaging pattern in which publishers send events to a server, and this server distributes the events to subscribers.
            Publishers and subscribers are decoupled through the server: they don't have any knowledge about each other. The connection between the two is only established via the topics.<br>
            Sending and receiving of events  are asynchronous.
         </p>
         <p>
            Publish &amp; Subscribe can be used for a huge variety of applications, e.g. chat, news updates, or, with low-latency implementations,  distribution of real-time data.<br>
            It scales well, and the fact that subscriptions need not be handled by publishers means that publishing is a light-weight process that can easily be added to applications.
         </p>

         <p>
            In {{ autobahnjs() }}, PubSub is implemented based on {{ wamp(short = false) }}, an open protocol that enables both PubSub and Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) over WebSocket. There is also a <a href="{{ url_for('page_js_tutorials_rpc') }}">tutorial for how to do RPC</a> using {{ autobahnjs() }}.
         </p>


         <p>
            In this tutorial well will create a small web app that connects to a WAMP demo server and sends and receives some PubSub events. Sending is via a HTML browser front-end, and the received events are logged on the browser console.
         </p>


      <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

         <p>
            For this tutorial, you will need a
            <ul>
               <li><a href="{{ url_for('page_home') }}">Web Browser with WebSockets</a>
            to run the web app, and</li>
               <li><a href="{{ url_for('page_home') }}">{{ autobahnpython() }}</a> to run the demo server which the web app connects to.</li>
            </ul>
         </p>

         <p>
         The full code for the web app can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/tavendo/AutobahnPython/blob/master/examples/pubsub/simple/index.html">Git Repository</a>. We'll go over all of it bit by bit now.
         </p>

      <h2>The WAMP RPC demo server</h2>

      <p>
         Browsers can only act as WebSockets clients, so we need something external to the browser to act as a sever. For this we provide a WAMP demo server written in Python.
      </p>
      <p>
         To run this, you need a few things installed. Fortunately, all of these are quick and easy to do.
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Download and install the <a href="http://www.python.org/getit/releases/2.7.2/">Python 2.7 installation package</a> for your system (just use the default settings for the installation).
         </li>
         <li>
            Download and install the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools">Python setuptools</a> (this makes the next install a breeze).
         </li>
         <li>
            In a command shell, type<br>
            <pre class="shell">easy_install autobahntestsuite</pre> This automatically downloads the install package. The {{ autobahntestsuite() }} contains the {{ autobahnpython() }} libraries as well as a test server for this and other tutorials.
         </li>
         <li>
            In the command shell, go to the python directory (e.g. 'Python27' on your C: drive if you installed with defaults under Windows). There, go to the 'lib' folder, and in that to the 'site-packages' folder. There you'll see an 'autobahn' folder (which has the version number appended at the end). Go to that folder and type<br>
            <pre class="shell">wstest -m wampserver</pre>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>That's it - the WAMP demo server is running. (It runs until you break out from the Python interpreter - Ctrl-C/D/Z depending on your platform).
      </p>
      <p>
         With this we have all the non-JavaScript stuff out of the way. From now on it's web technologies only.

      <h2>Including {{ autobahnjs() }}</h2>

         <p>To use PubSub in our web app, we need {{ autobahnjs() }}. We include the {{ autobahnjs() }} script in the head of our HTML:</p>

      <div class="codeex">
         <pre type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: xml; toolbar: false; auto-links: false;">
            &lt;head&gt;
               &lt;script src="http://autobahn.s3.amazonaws.com/js/autobahn.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
            &lt;&#47;head&gt;
         </pre>
      </div>

      <h2>Connecting to the server</h2>

         <p>
            The first thing we need to do if we want to use PubSub over WebSockets is to establish a WebSocket connection. WebSocket is built into modern browsers, so in principle we could use the built-in API for this.<br>
         {{ autobahnjs() }} wraps this browser functionality for WebSocket connections, and takes care of things like automatic reconnects. All our interaction for PubSub is then via {{ autobahnjs() }} - which makes things more straight forward.</p>
         <p>
            Initial interaction is via the 'ab' object that {{ autobahnjs() }} creates.
         </p>
         <p>
            We want the connecting to the server established once the document has finished loading, so we call our connect function via 'window.onload':
         </p>

      <div class="codeex">
         <pre class="brush: javascript; highlight: [4, 7, 14]; toolbar: false; auto-links: false;">
            window.onload = function() {

               // connect to WAMP server
               ab.connect("ws://localhost:9000",

                  // WAMP session was established
                  function (session) {

                     // things to do once the session has been established

                  },

                  // WAMP session is gone
                  function (code, reason) {

                     // things to do once the session fails
                  }
               );
            };
         </pre>
      </div>
         <p>
            In this anonymous function, the only thing we do directly is ask for a connection. This is via the 'connect' method of the 'ab' object (line 4).<br>
            We pass three arguments to the 'connect' method:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            The WebSockets address to connect to (line 4). This starts with the WebSockets protocol prefix 'ws' (instead of 'http' for regular web traffic), and here is the localhost on port 9000. It could equally be the IP of the machine you run the server on.
         </li>
         <li>
            A first function to execute once a connection has been established (starting at line 7). This is passed an object through which we can interact with the established WebSocket session.
         </li>
         <li>
            A second function to execute if the connection cannot be established (starting at line 14), or when the connection closes. This is passed arguments that give the reason for the failure.
         </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
         (The connect method also accepts a fourth argument, which allows fine-tuning of the options for the connect process, such as the maximum number of reconnect attempts. For this demo, we'll just use the defaults for these options.)
      </p>
         <a class="awh_up_developers" href="#top">Up</a>
            <br/>

      <h2>On connect</h2>

      <p>
         For an established connection, the following is executed:
      </p>

      <div class="codeex">
         <pre id="code" class="brush: javascript; highlight: [2, 3]; toolbar: false; auto-links: false;">
                  // WAMP session was established
                  function (session) {
                     sess = session;
                     console.log("Connected!");
                  }
         </pre>
      </div>

      <p>
         We bind the session object that is passed into the function (line 2) to a global variable 'sess' (line 4). In order to do this, we need to define 'sess' at the beginning of our JavaScript:
      </p>

      <div class="codeex">
         <pre id="code" class="brush: javascript; toolbar: false; auto-links: false; gutter: false;">
            // WAMP session object
            var sess;
         </pre>
      </div>

      <p>
         All interaction with the WebSocket session is then via this global object.
      </p>

      <p>
         In our example web app, we then log the fact that we are connected to the console.
      </p>
      <a class="awh_up_developers" href="#top">Up</a>
         <br/>

      <h2>Subscriptions</h2>

      <p>
         The other thing we do on connection is to subscribe to some topics.
      </p>
      <p>
         Like all PubSub interactions, subscriptions are made via the session object, which we access via the 'sess' global variable.
      </p>
      <div class="codeex">
         <pre class="brush: javascript; highlight: [7]; toolbar: false; auto-links: false;">
               // WAMP session was established
               function (session) {

                  sess = session;
                  console.log("Connected!");

                  sess.subscribe("http://example.com/simple", onEvent);

                  sess.prefix("event", "http://example.com/events/myevents");
                  sess.subscribe("event:firstevent", onEvent);
                  sess.subscribe("event:secondevent", onEvent);
               },
         </pre>
      </div>

      <p>
         As you can see, we make a subscription by calling the 'subscribe' method on the 'sess' object (line 7).
      </p>
      <p>
         This method takes two arguments: an identifier for the topic, and the name of a function to call when a subscription event is received.
      </p>
      <p>
         The 'onEvent' function that handles the subscription events is very simple in our demo app:
      </p>
      <div class="codeex">
         <pre class="brush: javascript; toolbar: false; auto-links: false;">
         function onEvent(topicUri, event) {
            console.log(topicUri);
            console.log(event);
         }
         </pre>
      </div>
      <p>
         It receives a topic URI for the event, as well as the event, and both are logged to the console.
      </p>
      <p>
         We'll take a closer look at some possible event data a bit later, when we go over publishing events. For now, let's see what the 'topic URI' is all about.
      </p>
      <a class="awh_up_developers" href="#top">Up</a>
         <br/>

      <h2>Topic URIs</h2>

      <p>
         WebSocket isn't the only web standard that WAMP is based on. To identify topics, WAMP uses URIs. These need to be properly formatted URIs, but there is no need for them to actually resolve to anything on the web.<br>
         They are used as identifiers within WAMP because URIs are a simple and established way of guaranteeing globally unique namespaces. Nobody needs to worry that their identifier for a topic conflicts with anybody else's, as long as it is within a domain that he or she controls.
      </p>
      <p>
         So URIs as identifiers for topics are useful in principle - but practically speaking, they can get a bit long. Nobody wants to remember, type or even just have to read something such as<br>
         <span class="ident_tut">http://example.com/events/myevents/firsteevent</span><br>
         or<br>
      <span class="ident_tut">http://example.com/events/myevents/secondevent</span><br>
      every time a subscription is made, canceled, or the resulting events handled.
      </p>
      <p>
         Session prefixes enable us to shorten this to something much more manageable. We just define a shorthand for any parts of URIs that repeat, e.g. in the above example, we would define a prefix for<br>
         <span class="ident_tut">http://example.com/events/myevents</span><br>
         and then use this when we reference the 'firstevent' or 'secondevent'.
      </p>
      <p>
         To define a prefix for an {{ autobahnjs() }} session, we use the 'prefix' method of the session object.
      </p>

      <div class="codeex">
         <pre class="brush: javascript; highlight: [9]; toolbar: false; auto-links: false;">
               // WAMP session was established
               function (session) {

                  sess = session;
                  console.log("Connected!");

                  sess.subscribe("http://example.com/simple", onEvent);

                  sess.prefix("event", "http://example.com/events/myeevents");
                  sess.subscribe("event:firstevent", onEvent);
                  sess.subscribe("event:secondevent", onEvent);
               },
         </pre>
      </div>

      <p>
         Calling the 'prefix' method (line 9) has now established 'event' as shorthand for<br>
         <span class="ident_tut">http://example.com/events/myevent/</span><br>
         By using the prefix, we can write<br>
         <span class="ident_tut">event:firstevent</span><br>
         instead of<br>
         <span class="ident_tut">http://example.com/events/myevent/firstevent</span><br>
         which saves us time when writing code, and makes everything much more readable.
      </p>
      <p>
         Prefixes are per-session, so we need to define them for every new connection.
       </p>
      <a class="awh_up_developers" href="#top">Up</a>
         <br/>


      <h2>Just Publish</h2>

      <p>
         Our demo web app is now subscribed to three topics, and logs any event received to the console.
      </p>
      <p>
         We now need some events to log, i.e. we need to add some publish features. The code so far did not have any need for an interface in the browser.<br>
         For publishing, we'll add a (small) bit of chrome:
      </p>
      <div class="codeex">
         <pre class="brush: xml; highlight: [7, 8, 9]; toolbar: false; auto-links: false;">
            &lt;div class="block"&gt;
               &lt;p&gt;
                  Publish a simple event containing no data. &lt;br&gt;
                  In a second browser window/tab with the demo web app, open the console
                  (hit 'F12') and you can see events being received.
               &lt;/p&gt;
               &lt;button onclick="sess.subscribe('http://example.com/simple', onEvent);"&gt;Subscribe&lt;/button&gt;
               &lt;button onclick="sess.unsubscribe('http://example.com/simple');"&gt;Unsubscribe&lt;/button&gt;
               &lt;button onclick="sess.publish('http://example.com/simple', null);"&gt;Publish&lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
         </pre>
      </div>

      <p>
         The three buttons enable subscribing to a hardcoded topic (line 7), unsubscribing from it (line 8), and publishing to it (line 9).
      </p>
      <p>
         As you can see, publishing is a simple method call on the session object (via the global variable 'sess'). This here is passed two arguments: the topic URI, and the contents of the event. Here the latter are set to 'null'.
      </p>
      <p>
         To see what this does open up a second browser window or tab with the demo app, open the console (hit 'F12'), and then press 'Publish' a couple of times in the first one.
      </p>
      <p>
         The published event is dispatched by the demo WAMP server to the second window/tab. On the console the topic URI and (null) content of the event are logged.
      </p>
      <p>
         Nothing is logged on the console of the first window/tab.
      </p>
      <a class="awh_up_developers" href="#top">Up</a>
         <br/>

      <h2>Publish with Event Data</h2>

      <p>
         Our demo app is subscribed to three topics. We'll now add an interface that enables publishing a message to one of the two latter ones, and to add some data for the event.
      </p>

      <div class="codeex">
         <pre class="brush: xml; highlight: [6, 7, 9, 10]; toolbar: false; auto-links: false;">

         &lt;div class="block"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
               Publish an event containing data.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;form&gt;
               &lt;p&gt;Message: &lt;input id="form_message" type="text" size="50" maxlength="50" value="Hello, world!"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
               &lt;p&gt;Flag: &lt;input id="form_flag" type="checkbox"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
               &lt;p&gt;Event:
                  &lt;input id="event1" type="radio" name="eventtype" checked&gt;MyEvent 1
                  &lt;input type="radio" name="eventtype"&gt;MyEvent 2
               &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
            &lt;button onclick="publishEvent()"&gt;Publish Event&lt;/button&gt;
         &lt;/div&gt;
         </pre>
      </div>

      <p>
         This interface enables us to input a message text (line 6), toggle a flag (line 7) and decide which of the two available topics this will be published under (lines 9 & 10).
      </p>
      <p>
         The 'Publish Event' button calls the following 'publishEvent' function:
      </p>
      <div class="codeex">
         <pre class="brush: javascript; highlight: [3, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14]; toolbar: false; auto-links: false;">
         function publishEvent()
         {
            evt = {};

            evt.name = document.getElementById('form_message').value;
            evt.flag = document.getElementById('form_flag').checked;

            evt.num = 23;
            evt.created = new Date();
            evt.rand = Math.random();

            var excludeMe = false;

            if (document.getElementById('event1').checked) {
               sess.publish("event:firstevent", evt, excludeMe);
            } else {
               sess.publish("event:secondevent", evt, excludeMe);
            }
         }
         </pre>
      </div>

      <p>
         Here we initialize an 'evt' object than will contain the event data to be sent (line 3). Any JavaScript object can be sent as event data - so we'll fill it with a few different items.
      </p>
      <p>
         We first get the two items of data that can be set via the UI.<br>
         Then we add some more data:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            A hard-coded number (line 8)
         </li>
         <li>
            The current datetime (line 9)
         </li>
         <li>
            A random number (line 10)
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         We check for the state of the radio buttons (line 14), and publish our event data on one of two topics accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
         There's a little addition here, as well:<br>
         A 'excludeMe' variable (line 12) that we pass to the 'publish' function as a third argument, and which was not used in the hardcoded simple publish.

      <p>
         This third argument is, as we've seen, optional. It is a boolean value, and the default if nothing is passed is 'true'.
      </p>
      <p>
         The effect of us setting this to 'false' for our publishing here is that the event is now dispatched to the window/tab that publishes it as well.
      </p>
      <p>
         This is switched off by default because it is first of all not really necessary on the side of the publisher - he has knowledge of the event data. Additionally, this may necessitate filtering by the publisher, to exclude self-published events.

      <h2>Summary & Beyond</h2>
      <p>This tutorial gave an overview how simple PubSub messaging is with {{ autobahnjs() }} - no more than a line of code each for either subscribing and publishing.</p>
      <p>We encourage you to play around with the WAMP demo server and with the demo app. Run it on different machines. Add more event data. Use the received events to trigger functions that do more than just log things (for a neat little example of this, take a look at the <a href="{{ url_for('page_home')}}">BeatBox Real-Time Demo</a>).
      <p>
         If you're interested, the <a href="{{ url_for('page_home')}}">PubSub Tutorial</a> shows you an equally quick and easy start into publish & subscribe with {{ autobahnjs() }}. Or go to the <a href="{{ url_for('page_python_examples')}}">Python tutorials</a> to start exploring how the WAMP demo server works.
