<span class="c">##</span>
<span class="c">## Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes</span>

<span class="c">##</span>

<span class="c">##</span>
<span class="c">## 1xx Informational</span>
<span class="c">##</span>
<span class="c">## Request received, continuing process.</span>
<span class="c">##</span>
<span class="c">## This class of status code indicates a provisional response, consisting only of</span>
<span class="c">## the Status-Line and optional headers, and is terminated by an empty line.</span>
<span class="c">## Since HTTP/1.0 did not define any 1xx status codes, servers must not send</span>
<span class="c">## a 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0 client except under experimental conditions.</span>
<span class="c">##</span>

<span class="n">CONTINUE</span>                 <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Continue&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                            <span class="s">&quot;This means that the server has received the request headers, and that the client should proceed to send the request body (in the case of a request for which a body needs to be sent; for example, a POST request). If the request body is large, sending it to a server when a request has already been rejected based upon inappropriate headers is inefficient. To have a server check if the request could be accepted based on the request&#39;s headers alone, a client must send Expect: 100-continue as a header in its initial request[2] and check if a 100 Continue status code is received in response before continuing (or receive 417 Expectation Failed and not continue).&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">SWITCHING_PROTOCOLS</span>      <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">101</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Switching Protocols&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                            <span class="s">&quot;This means the requester has asked the server to switch protocols and the server is acknowledging that it will do so.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

                            <span class="s">&quot;As a WebDAV request may contain many sub-requests involving file operations, it may take a long time to complete the request. This code indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet.[3] This prevents the client from timing out and assuming the request was lost.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">CHECKPOINT</span>               <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">103</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Checkpoint&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                            <span class="s">&quot;This code is used in the Resumable HTTP Requests Proposal to resume aborted PUT or POST requests.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">REQUEST_URI_TOO_LONG</span>     <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">122</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Request-URI too long&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                            <span class="s">&quot;This is a non-standard IE7-only code which means the URI is longer than a maximum of 2083 characters.[5][6] (See code 414.)&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c">##</span>
<span class="c">## 2xx Success</span>
<span class="c">##</span>
<span class="c">## This class of status codes indicates the action requested by the client was</span>

                            <span class="s">&quot;Standard response for successful HTTP requests. The actual response will depend on the request method used. In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource. In a POST request the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">CREATED</span>                  <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">201</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Created&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>

                            <span class="s">&quot;The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The request might or might not eventually be acted upon, as it might be disallowed when processing actually takes place.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">NON_AUTHORATIVE</span>          <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">203</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Non-Authoritative Information (since HTTP/1.1)&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>

                            <span class="s">&quot;The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content. Unlike a 204 response, this response requires that the requester reset the document view.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">PARTIAL_CONTENT</span>          <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">206</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Partial Content&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                            <span class="s">&quot;The server is delivering only part of the resource due to a range header sent by the client. The range header is used by tools like wget to enable resuming of interrupted downloads, or split a download into multiple simultaneous streams.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">MULTI_STATUS</span>             <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">207</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Multi-Status (WebDAV) (RFC 4918)&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                            <span class="s">&quot;The message body that follows is an XML message and can contain a number of separate response codes, depending on how many sub-requests were made.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">IM_USED</span>                  <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">226</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;IM Used (RFC 3229)&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                            <span class="s">&quot;The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c">##</span>
<span class="c">## 3xx Redirection</span>
<span class="c">##</span>
<span class="c">## The client must take additional action to complete the request.</span>
<span class="c">##</span>
<span class="c">## This class of status code indicates that further action needs to be taken</span>
<span class="c">## by the user agent in order to fulfil the request. The action required may</span>
<span class="c">## be carried out by the user agent without interaction with the user if and</span>
<span class="c">## only if the method used in the second request is GET or HEAD. A user agent</span>
<span class="c">## should not automatically redirect a request more than five times, since such</span>
<span class="c">## redirections usually indicate an infinite loop.</span>

<span class="n">MULTIPLE_CHOICES</span>         <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">300</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Multiple Choices&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                            <span class="s">&quot;Indicates multiple options for the resource that the client may follow. It, for instance, could be used to present different format options for video, list files with different extensions, or word sense disambiguation.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">MOVED_PERMANENTLY</span>        <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">301</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Moved Permanently&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                            <span class="s">&quot;This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

                            <span class="s">&quot;This is an example of industrial practice contradicting the standard. HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945) required the client to perform a temporary redirect (the original describing phrase was &#39;Moved Temporarily&#39;, but popular browsers implemented 302 with the functionality of a 303 See Other. Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes 303 and 307 to distinguish between the two behaviours. However, some Web applications and frameworks use the 302 status code as if it were the 303.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">SEE_OTHER</span>                <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">303</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;See Other (since HTTP/1.1)&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                            <span class="s">&quot;The response to the request can be found under another URI using a GET method. When received in response to a POST (or PUT/DELETE), it should be assumed that the server has received the data and the redirect should be issued with a separate GET message.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">NOT_MODIFIED</span>             <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">304</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Not Modified&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                            <span class="s">&quot;Indicates the resource has not been modified since last requested.[2] Typically, the HTTP client provides a header like the If-Modified-Since header to provide a time against which to compare. Using this saves bandwidth and reprocessing on both the server and client, as only the header data must be sent and received in comparison to the entirety of the page being re-processed by the server, then sent again using more bandwidth of the server and client.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">USE_PROXY</span>                <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">305</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Use Proxy (since HTTP/1.1)&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                            <span class="s">&quot;Many HTTP clients (such as Mozilla[11] and Internet Explorer) do not correctly handle responses with this status code, primarily for security reasons.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">SWITCH_PROXY</span>             <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">306</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Switch Proxy&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                            <span class="s">&quot;No longer used. Originally meant &#39;Subsequent requests should use the specified proxy&#39;.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">TEMPORARY_REDIRECT</span>       <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">307</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Temporary Redirect (since HTTP/1.1)&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                            <span class="s">&quot;In this occasion, the request should be repeated with another URI, but future requests can still use the original URI.[2] In contrast to 303, the request method should not be changed when reissuing the original request. For instance, a POST request must be repeated using another POST request.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">RESUME_INCOMPLETE</span>        <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">308</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Resume Incomplete&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>

<span class="c">##</span>
<span class="c">## 4xx Client Error</span>
<span class="c">##</span>
<span class="c">## The 4xx class of status code is intended for cases in which the client</span>
<span class="c">## seems to have erred. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server</span>
<span class="c">## should include an entity containing an explanation of the error situation,</span>
<span class="c">## and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. These status codes are</span>
<span class="c">## applicable to any request method. User agents should display any included</span>
<span class="c">## entity to the user. These are typically the most common error codes</span>
<span class="c">## encountered while online.</span>
<span class="c">##</span>

<span class="n">BAD_REQUEST</span>              <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">400</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Bad Request&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>

                            <span class="s">&quot;Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is possible but has failed or not yet been provided.[2] The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. See Basic access authentication and Digest access authentication.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">PAYMENT_REQUIRED</span>         <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">402</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Payment Required&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                            <span class="s">&quot;Reserved for future use.[2] The original intention was that this code might be used as part of some form of digital cash or micropayment scheme, but that has not happened, and this code is not usually used. As an example of its use, however, Apple&#39;s MobileMe service generates a 402 error if the MobileMe account is delinquent.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
